# Earthquake-Data-Analysis-Project
This is a simple project of data collection and Analysis of a specific region in the World (Mindinao, South Phillipines) and its data regarding Earthquake location, magnitude, and time period it occurred. <br><br>
Note: There is an error with the animation of this project, but it does not affect the actual use of data collection and analysis for this project, the animation is simply an "extra bonus" component. <br><br>
This code can be modified to analyze any part of the world for earthquake data, using the region of South Phillipines is used as an example of how the code works for a specific region of the world. To change the region to analyze, just change the minimum/maximum longtitude and lattitude variables, and to change the time range to see what Earthquakes happened at what time, change the time variable.
